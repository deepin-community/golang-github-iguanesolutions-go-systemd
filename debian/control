Description: Golang bindings for systemd (library)
 Easily communicate with systemd when run as daemon within a service
 unit.
 .
 With notifier you can notify to systemd that your program is starting,
 stopping, reloading...
 .
 For example, if your daemon needs some time for initializing its
 controllers before really being considered as ready, you can specify to
 systemd that this is a "notify" service and send it a notification when
 ready.
 .
 It is safe to use it even if systemd notify support is disabled (noop
 call).
